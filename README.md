# Best Practices for Discord Bot Lists
*Bot lists must meet these minimum requirements to be considered a bot list.*

---


1. Your bot list must have a respectable TLD. (.tk does not count)
2. Your bot list should not be hosted on glitch domain. (You are allowed to use Glitch as long as its always up and functioning fine)
3. Your bot list should not display all the listed bots on the front page.
4. Your bot list must be usable. No broken links/buttons.
5. Your bot list must have consistent uptime. (Minor downtime for fixing a problem is fine)
